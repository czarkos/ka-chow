    This test replicates the results of Fig. 23 of the paper.

    We show the effects of voltage scaling on the energy efficiency and

    We can see that increasing the supply voltage increases throughput and
    compute density at the cost of lower energy efficiency.

    Modeled and reference compute density varies because we did not model the
    area of some miscellaneous components, leading to the model having a smaller
    area and higher compute density. This could be corrected by adding
    additional components to the model. We also use a different scaling factor
    for voltage versus energy, leading to a different curve shape. This could be
    corrected by adjusting the VOLTAGE_ENERGY_SCALE formula and propagating the
    value to each subcomponent model.

    ### Exploration of Full-System Energy Efficiency

    In this test, we look at the full-system energy breakdown when running DNNs
    on a CiM accelerator. We place the macro in a chip with local input/output
    buffers, routers for on-chip data movement, a global buffer, and DRAM. We
    show the area and energy spent on DRAM, the global buffer, and other
    components.

    We compare three scenarios:

    1. Inputs, outputs, and weights stored off-chip in DRAM and fetched for each
       layer
    2. Inputs and outputs fetched from DRAM, weights stationary (pre-loaded for
       each layer)
    3. Weights stationary, layers fused to keep inputs/outputs on-chip in the
       global

    We can see that weight-stationary processing significantly reduces overall
    energy due to fewer weight fetches from off-chip. Benefits are limited,
    however, because inputs and outputs still must be fetched from off-chip. To
    see further benefits, fusing layers is necessary to keep data on-chip
    between DNN layers. We note that weight-stationary CiM requires sufficient
    memory to keep all DNN weights on-chip. To store large DNNs, this may
    require a multi-chip pipeline or dense storage technologies.
